### Additional Info

The majority of the code was run on an AWS EC2 p2.xlarge instance (Python 3.6 and Keras 2.0.8). The public DNS of this instance is ec2-18-219-45-93.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com.

### Instructions to Run EC2 Instance:
1. SSH into the instance.
```
ssh -i "data2040-dl.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-219-45-93.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```
2. CD into the git repo and run jupyter notebook.
```
cd DATA2040-DLPython
jupyter notebook
```
3. Go to the address below and ignore the warning by clicking advanced, then continue.
```
https://ec2-18-219-45-93.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8888
```
